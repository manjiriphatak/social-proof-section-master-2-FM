## My process

First I started of by building the basic HTMl structure of the page and then moved on to styling.
I kept the workflow Mobile first and when I was satisfied with the small screen look of the page I moved on to setting the media queries.
While working on custom CSS properties for bigger screens I first focused on centering my main component to the screen.
Then I moved on to individual components and used display-flex to position the ratings and testimonial sections.
Also added media queries to change the backround Images.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt and used CSS Grid for the first time. Coding Mobile first really helped me be able to use and understand grid better. I also learnt how to use flex and grid together. Learning how to position components on the screen was a challenge but Going through a lot of resources and articles online I was finally able to understand the cncept and use it properly.

### Continued development

I would be working on more projects that involve use of CSS custom properties- Grid and Flex to gain more confidence in this area.
